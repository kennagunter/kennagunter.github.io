    <h1> Persona </h1>
        <P> A 19 year old who plays many sports and loves to be outdoors and go on adventures, but he lives in Idaho where the weather is so unpredictable, one day it can be super warm and the next day you are having flash floods, or even in a few hours the weather is completely different. He always likes to know what kind of clothing and equipment he will need for his next adventure, but gathering all the equipment he needs for a certain activity can take some time so he just needs to quickly know what the weather will be like for the next few hours and even days so he can pack to be prepared. </P>
    <h1> Wireframes</h1>
        <ul> <li><a href="https://wireframe.cc/zeQRB3 ">Large Frame</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://wireframe.cc/3kWfHx "> Medium Frame</a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://wireframe.cc/f24oXA ">Small Frame </a></li>
        </ul>
    <h1> Peer Review</h1>
        <p> Your site wireframes look really good, just avoid whitespace and just keep it simple like you have it. You have a few spelling errors and I also think that your purpose statement could be a little more descriptive. -Alexandra Leon </p>
        
        <p> I tried to get rid of whitespace that I personally saw and then I fixed the spelling errors and I tried to make my purpose statement a little more descriptive.</p>
