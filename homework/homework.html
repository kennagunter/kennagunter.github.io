        <h2> Visitor Analysis </h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Demographics: This site includes the age range of about 16 to 30 years old females.The income of someone who looks at this site doesn't even have to range very high- someone even with a minimum wage job would be okay to shop on this site. The education level would be currently enrolled or high school graduate. This site is based out of Logan, Utah. They do offer there services throughout the US.</li>
                <li> This site meets the needs of visitor because its simple and to the point, you can immediately navigate to what you want to look at. They have very detailed navigation tags that even have pictures to help guide you.There aren't annoying ads on the page that distract from the purpose of the site.  </li>
                <li> The Site was more enjoyable because it was pretty much exactly like the computer experience, it allows for easy access to everything, and nothing is squished on the page or too small that you have to scroll in. </li>
                <li> The site definitely facilitates those in a mobile environment, you can still do    what you need to and you can do it on the go, faster and quicker. I personally like it better on my phone</li>   
            </ul> 
        
         <h3> Persona </h3>
            <p> An 18 Year Old Girl named Marlee, loves to be caught up with todays latest trends that are modest and reasonably priced. She follows all her favorite boutiques and shops on Instagram and she constantly sees cute new clothes on her Instagram feed. She loves online shopping, and so when she sees new things on insta she of course visits the site to look for that cute new shirt she saw, to check the price and maybe even purchase the item. </p>
        
        <h4> Site Contrast </h4>
            <ul>
                <li> The Worst Site I Came across during the 24 hours was BYUIDAHO ILEARN https://byui.brightspace.com/d2l/home </li>
                <li> The best site knew that most people look at their social media and then visit there site so most who visit are tech savy and are familiar with mobile browsing, the worst site didnt realize that it would be easier to pull this up on the go but it makes it too difficult for that.</li>
                <li> The best site made it super easy to navigate where I wanted to go, It was simple and I could tell how to get from thing to thing. Ilearn made it very complicated for me to navigate to different things, and some things couldn't even be done mobily.</li>
                <li> The best site definitely encourages people to look at there site even on a mobile device, where as the worst I would rather just access it on my computer.</li>
        </ul>
